Front-end
For this application, I decided to use EJS for the front-end portion. Because I have already used it in three projects so far,
I felt really confident using it for this project. Being able to directly use JavaScript in the EJS file really helped to 
accelerate the learning curve. 

Back-end
For this application, I decided to use Node.js for the back-end portion. I chose Node.js because it is a JavaScript runtime environment and
uses event-driven I/O model which makes it extremely efficient. 

Grocery list description
- You are only able to view the lists you've created.
- Allows you to create a shopping list.
- Allows you sign in from any device to view your shopping list.
- You are able to create, edit and add items to lists.
- By having all of the lists saved, you can easily pull it up and reuse it if you are planning on making the same meal.

In the future, with more time, I'd like to add in a collaborators option to allow a user to share their list. If people are going shopping
together, this would allow them to both look for items and not get the same item twice.
